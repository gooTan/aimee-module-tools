 * declaration instead of restating each by hand in a separate registry.

 * to git — the exact thing require_aimee_git forbids. index_find_callers was
 * MCP-only, so a review panel asked "is this still called?" had no tool that could
 * answer and hedged on a symbol with twelve callers one query away. Both shipped
 * green and were found by watching a delegate on real hardware.
 *
 * Reusing the MCP schema rather than writing a native one is deliberate: a second
 * hand-written schema is how git_commit came to advertise parameters (add_all,
 * set_upstream) that its handler had never accepted.
 *
 * `call` runs the tool; `advert` returns its MCP tools/list entry ({"description",
